Hi! I’m Susan, a Registered Dietitian and lover of tasty food.

I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio and I fall more in love with the city every day (well, except for the construction and snow)! I received a B.S. from San Diego State University in Foods and Nutrition, and a M.S. from Illinois State University in Food, Nutrition and Dietetics, where I also completed a Dietetic Internship with over 1300 hours of supervised practice experience.

I work with clients every day who want to improve their eating habits, and most are stuck in a “diet” mentality. It’s my goal to help others realize you can eat tasty, flavorful food, while still providing your body with the nutrients it craves.

My favorite foods are pineapple, broccoli, dark chocolate and wine. I love trying new restaurants, but I also crave eating salads at home. Cooking is my stress reliever, but sometimes a busy life gets in the way. I often dread going to the gym, but I love the feeling after a butt-kicking workout. I’m a Midwestern meat-and-potatoes girl at heart, and I also get excited to try ethnic flavors. You CAN have it all – the key is learning to practice moderation.

​A healthy lifestyle is not a destination – it’s a journey, and it’s a lifelong process. Let’s take the trip together!
