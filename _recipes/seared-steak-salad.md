title: Seared Steak Salad
---

INGREDIENTS

8 oz sirloin steak

2 Tbsp favorite dry rub

1 ear corn, grilled

1 sweet potato, roasted

1 avocado, diced

5 oz cherry tomatoes, cut in half (I like to get a variety of colors for an even prettier plate!)

1/2 red onion, diced and

6 cups baby kale

Raspberry vinaigrette, if desired

DIRECTIONS

Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbsp canola oil and swirl to coat. While pan is heating, generously rub in dry rub into steak to well season.
When skillet is hot, add steak. This will create quite a bit of steam, so make sure to turn on your stovetop fan, or open windows, unless you want your fire alarms to go off! Cook steak until medium rare, about 3 minutes per each side. Remove from skillet and place on a cutting board to rest.
While steak rests, make the salad. Layer corn, roasted sweet potatoes, tomatoes, avocado, and red onion on top of a bed of baby kale.
Slice steak into thin strips. Place on top of salad. Drizzle with raspberry vinaigrette, if desired.
