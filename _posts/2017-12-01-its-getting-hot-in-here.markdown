These are a few things that I love…

1. Rap music (yes, I know, so random… don’t @ me)
2. Cooking
3. Eating roasted vegetables
4. Combining my top 3 favorite things

If you have the pleasure of following me on Snapchat or my Instagram stories, you may have noticed by now that I get way more entertainment than I should out of blasting some R&B/Hip Hop in my kitchen while I experiment with new recipes. And apparently I’m not alone (#mealtime anyone? I think 2 Chainz is my idol…).

While listening to some G-Easy “No Limit,” I was thinking about my favorite holiday (Thanksgiving – I’m a foodie, duh.) and how to incorporate some more veggies than we’re used to eating at this meal (yes, a foodie, but also an RD.. it’s a blessing and a curse). I tried a Brussels sprout and bacon recipe last year that completely failed, but I wasn’t ready to give up on this cruciferous beauty just yet.

There’s just something about roasted veggies that I absolutely love. They’re crispy, tender, and the high-heat preparation method seems to intensify flavors (not to mention that they surprising retain most of their nutrients through this cooking process.. besides losing a few of the water soluble vitamins, like C and the B-complex). I generally try to eat seasonally, as I find best quality in produce that is in season (and it’s not like I live in CA anymore where EVERYTHING is in season ALL OF THE TIME 😢). And since it’s been getting too cold to grill outdoors (which is my preferred method of cooking, tbh), I wanted to play around with throwing some things in the oven.

The seasoning for the veggies is completely random. I wanted to keep the Brussels sprouts pretty plain, as they really don’t need a whole lot to spice them up. The sweet potatoes got a little bit of brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, probably because I’ve been dreaming of pumpkin-spiced everything since my birthday at the end of September. I wanted to play with the sweet and savory flavor profile a little more by adding some texture (hence, the nuts) and some more intense sweetness (dried cranberries). There’s obviously many variations that you could take with this recipe (Butternut squash, pepitas, broccoli instead of Brussels sprouts, etc), so you’ll have to let me know what you come up with! I prefer the salad to be chilled, but it is prettttttty tasty right after the veggies come out of the oven too.

Check out the whole recipe [here](https://thefoodietitian.wordpress.com/roasted-brussels-sprouts-and-sweet-potatoes/), and enjoy the deliciousness (maybe you’ll even convince your friends and family to eat an extra serving of veggies today)!
