Do you crave certain foods in certain seasons? Like the Spring makes me want light, fresh salads and the Summer always makes me want refreshing melon and the Fall makes me want pumpkin everything and the Winter makes me want hearty stews. I think ice cream is the only exception for me, which I could eat in literally any weather. 80 degrees with 75% humidity? Oh, you know I’m hitting up the Jeni’s down the street. Polar Vortex? Gimme some Ben and Jerry’s and a cuddly blanket. Maybe that makes me a psychopath, but I’m willing to accept it… ANYWAYS, I digress.

This time of year, I’ve really been wanting something warm and comforting in my belly.  There’s actually some interesting psychology behind “comfort foods” (check out this super interesting article here). The term originated back around 1966 when a study was researching the affects of our moods on food choices and rates of obesity. I don’t think I’m making a revolutionary statement to say that most of us eat for reasons other than hunger. We often eat when we’re stressed/sad/lonely/happy/angry/tired.. and this is often something so deep rooted and habitual that we don’t even realize we’re doing it until half the box of Krispie Kreme’s is gone. I work with clients every day to help re-wire these tendencies, and this can take months, if not years to get under control. We often start with trying to identify which emotions make us eat, then we work on trying to find a substitute for food when we are in these situations (here’s one of my favorite lists of 101 things to do instead of eat). Seems simple enough, right?

Eh, it may seem that way, but there’s so much more to eating than just the food. Often times the social situation drives our choices, and we have family traditions that we often unknowingly follow, and when your friends are eating pizza and drinking beer, it makes you want to eat pizza and drink beer… right??!? Not that there’s anything wrong with any of these behaviors, but if you start to realize that you’re rarely eating because you’re hungry and instead are eating because other people are or because you can’t get that chocolate chip cookie out of your head, it may lead to other complications/health risks down the road.

But not to fear! The foodie in me is determined that you can have foods in your diet that are both comforting to your soul AND your body. Take this skillet apple chicken thigh recipe, for example. It’s warm, rich in flavor, hearty, and only 350 calories per serving. I love how the chicken thighs cook and practically fall apart once they’re on your plate, and the combination of apple (I used fuji, but any would work – I would just avoid granny smith) and red onion is TO DIE FOR. I paired this meal with a baby spinach salad with the remaining red onion, goat cheese, and pomegranate seeds and a délicieux French baguette (#carbsmakemehappy).

So gather your friends and family and think about starting some new “comfort food” traditions – but don’t completely give up on grandma’s famous mac and cheese recipe, because that shit’s delicious.

Stay hungry, my friends. ❤️
