Crock pot season begins mid-to-late October and ends never. I‚Äôm guessing that this beautiful kitchen appliance isn‚Äôt new to most of you, even if you are more of a novice cook. According to the Huffington Post, in 2011, 83% of families owned a slow cooker. That‚Äôs incredible! Maybe the Crock Pot should run for office, because it seems like it‚Äôs the one thing Americans can agree on (Too political? Is this not the right outlet? You‚Äôre saying I should stick to food?? Bueller? Bueller? Ok, back to business).

Time for some foodietitian food science! ü§ì

Why do we love the slow cooker? It makes our meats both tender and juicy at the same time, it ‚Äúcooks all day while the cook‚Äôs away,‚Äù and you can make a variety of foods ‚Äì from beans to soups to pastas to bread!

A slow cooker has a few parts. 1 ‚Äì the ceramic or porcelain bowl, which distributes heat evenly, 2- the heating unit, which surrounds the bowl and heats from the bottom and the sides, and 3- a glass lid to keep heat contained inside the bowl.

Slow cookers work by providing constant heat over an extended period of time to food. For meats, especially, this ‚Äúslow and low‚Äù cooking method allows the collagen (connective tissue) to break down and become very tender. A typical Crock Pot will reach between 190-250 degrees F, which is right around the temperature needed to make water boil (212¬∞F). This cooking method became popular for families on a budget, because most affordable (aka cheaper) meats contain more collagen and less marbling (the fat distribution throughout cuts of meat, which determines the quality of the cut), meaning that they are tougher to cook and don‚Äôt hold up to many dry-heat cooking methods. However, when moisture (typically broth, water, sauces, etc), lower temperatures (than say, a grill), and time are applied to these meats, they become tender and juicy.

There‚Äôs actually a very specific science when it comes to cooking meat, and you can read more about this here.

Slow cookers also do a great job of cooking vegetables, grains, and legumes. Root vegetables (like carrots, potatoes, and butternut squash) often take longer than meat to cook, so adding them to a slow cooker is a great way to ensure that they tenderize. Oats, lentils, and rice can also cook all day in a slow cooker, due to the fact that liquids are used in the cooking process.

Some foods don‚Äôt cook as well for long periods of time in these machines, including pastas, some more delicate vegetables (like kale, zucchini, and fresh herbs), and instant grains (like instant oatmeal or instant rice). Other foods cook very quickly, and should be added towards the end of the cooking process, including fish/seafood and dairy products.

There are hundreds (if not thousands) of websites and blogs with amazing slow cooker recipes, but if you‚Äôre in the mood for something hearty and flavorful, try my Chicken and Lentil Crock Pot Curry. I love how these flavors work together, and you can play around with the spiciness to find what works best with your taste buds.

I‚Äôd love to hear your favorite Crock Pot classics ‚Äì comment below or send me a message and we can geek out about flavor combinations together. üòäüôÉ

I hope you enjoy the rest of your week as much as I‚Äôll enjoy eating all of these leftovers!

Until next week!

Ciao, üòò
